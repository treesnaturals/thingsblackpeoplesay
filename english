From my rendez-vous of meeting up with a black man every once in a while to achieve these results from my speaking. 



1. Saves time, brother.

2. Guess who dressed for twins.

3. Look at all the little outfits I got them.

4. That's why I am training.

5. So what did we miss in church.

6. She had a dress on so tight, you could see her heartbeat.

7. And the message, it was so deep.

8. I'm gonna take a vow of silence.

19. I've been trying to get that waiter to come over for 20 minutes.

20. You afraid I'll send your kids to school with sailor clothes and kinky hair.

21. It is never our intention.

22. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm going to the ladies room.

23. I'm sure there's a rational explanation behind their decision.

24. But nothing is under my skin like my sister.

25. How all of that somehow makes me disqualified to care for kids that I've been caring for since they came into this world.

26. It's not like we didn't have a good reason.

27. They haven't started their own family yet.

28. That does not make her the boss of me. 

29. Alright sis, lets go fix your car.

30. I didn't think you could do it.

31. Maybe thats the reason why god give to you.

32. Clearly, baby, you've had to much to drink.

47. What do you mean, flame?

48. I have never seen anything like it.

49. That's because she was busy.

50. Isn't this a good suprise?

51. You have been avoiding my call.

52. You know what the good thing about me is, is I don't care.

53. So where do you see yourself getting married.

54. Options, I love it.

55. But if we were to limit it to just family, it would be in the 100's.

56. Have you thought of the time?

57. I asked her to come over to get some ideas.

58. We can go to Hometown Buffet.

69. She used to bring it over to the house in a brown paper bag.

70. We didn't waste money we didn't have.

488. I would like to propose a toast.

489. I aint step foot in the club.

490. I don't know what she is talking about.

491. Your still trying to figure out what were doing.

492. Before I conquer that fear, I'm going to see what it's like in the zone.

493. Say it with me.

494. I got my eye on this dude.

495. I'm going to find out these kids intentions.

496. Nice seeing you.

497. But the good has got to do what he can.

498. I feel so bad about spilling the beans.

499. That we would date someone like you.

500. I'm just protective like a good father should be.

501. I'm going to give him a taste of his own medicine.

502. The reason this happened is because she is so far away from me.

503. It is not my job to be moral police for my dad.

504. It really brought me a sense of pride.

505. Look at her new car!

506. I'm just happy to be around my family.

507. I don't want to sacrifice our friendship.

508. Where's this coming from right here?

509. I've been seeing things, I've been hearing things.

514. I fell back into my old ways and I lost my chance.

515. I pushed your flight back.

516. I know I can bounce back.

519. I'm still hustlin' with my family.

520. I mean, I wouldn't mind.

521. Maybe I could use it to get some gossip.

522. You want to do a little jumping around.

523. You put it in a ponytail.

524. I look like I've got some teeth missing or something.

525. I'm going to bring it out to an old time favorite.

526. You just watch and learn.

527. That looks like a real cookie.

528. We don't ask him.

529. Then he knows somethings up.

530. Would you like one?

531. You don't have to do it like that.

532. Everyone is treated like loyalty.

533. I'm sorry for not stopping that ugly rumor about you.

537. They seem to be working for me.

538. Your safe with us.

540. Right now all we have to do is hide them from our parents.

541. You're eating us out of the house.

542. While we were trying to find out what to do, mom was on a search of her own.

543. Haven't seen you for a while.

544. I'll just step over here.

545. Just a little church humor.

546. I could see myself as a missionary type.

547. This place looks like a pigsty.

548. Maybe someone needs help or something.

549. We had to rescue him.

550. This could all be part of a bigger plan.

551. I betcha he says that to all the girls.

552. Were gonna find you a brand new home.

553. You must admit he's awfully cute.

554. It's the middle of the night.

555. I've been doing a lot of talking to my maker.

556. Why is your mission costing me money?

557. Don't you girls ever do this again.

558. I just wanted to tell you to have a good life.

559. I can't wait to see it.

560. The council is concerned for men only.

561. Your saying woman aren't fit to lead?

562. We need to start some committee assignments. 

563. Just the way you like it.

564. Let me set you straight on something, bro.

565. What made you think a visit to my house was in order?

566. Only if you allow me to take you to dinner.

567. Then why don't you jam that smoothie down your throat.

568. That's quite a sound system you got there.

569. Your lucky that door fell off.

570. That's gotta be worth something.

571. We going to be rolling in my new ride.

572. It doesn't matter who called it first.

573. I've worn everything I own like 5 times.

574. I'm happy to see my business is my business.

575. To retrace your steps and see where you lost your mind.

576. The front lights are retractable, just like your head.

577. That the birds would stop their chirping and listen in awe.

578. Because you're moving much to fast here.

579. You need to come up to a solution.

580. I knew you would come to your senses.

581. I want something that fits who I am.

582. My next offer might not be as generous.

583. I'll see you at dinner.

584. You most certainly do.

585. You're never going to beat my employee discount.

586. We will never tell you when to go to bed. *white one*

587. My offer is more than fair.

588. That is not a bad profit.

620. Dad gave you a virus? That's awesome.

621. I haven't eaten like this for years.

622. This is just like a sunday dinner.

624. We got some sweet potato pound cake.

625. If it is okay with him, it is okay with me.

626. Can I borrow your credit card?

634. Yall are acting like you just got your income check.

635. I was a little unsure at first.

636. Nice to met you, and I'm not that young.

637. Okay so you like the little sugar baby, huh?

638. We wanted to, but were still rusty in that department.

639. Well did you have protection?

640. So girl what's the problem?

641. You know you was always a little slut-fish.

642. How many times you throw down in one night?

657. We have a lot more catching up to do.

658. Your home early.

659. If you were, then you would probably be disturbed.

661. Every now and then I need some times with the boys.

662. I don't want to interfere with your momma time.

663. I asked the same thing.

664. She's going to be sleeping in your room, so make sure it's clean.

665. He told me he doesn't want me around.

666. We can prove to him that we fit in.

667. I'm not letting you spend that money on baby pants.

668. You are being unreasonable.

669. I thought that is what I just did.

670. She got all up in your head.

671. What are you guys going to get?

672. How am I supposed to know what he is doing?

673. I guess I do need to conserve the battery.

674. This would look good on your toes.

675. Me and your toes are going to need a moment to ourselves.

676. Everybody else is just a baby mama.

690. My first thoughts were that she is beautiful.

691. There are experiences that everybody has to do.

692. I'm just going to try and keep myself grounded.

693. I think I can pull it off.

694. She don't want that.

695. He's a good-looking dude.

696. I'm a little attracted to him.

697. You already know who gonna win.

733. You're going to build something original that no one else will have.

743. I'll come once you're out of that car.

744. I'm about ready to explode.

745. She didn't do it when she was with you.

746. The reason I went to the car wash is because I got a coupon.

839. Why don't you just go and get your money?

840. You've been acting weird the past couple of days.

841. You have a girl crush on me.

842. The reason why I've been acting so weird is that I have been having dirty dreams.

843. Who wants to be with a man no one else wants.

844. It reminds me that he used to be romantic.

845. I still couldn't be your momma.

846. I think he stole it because he was dressed up as a pirate.
